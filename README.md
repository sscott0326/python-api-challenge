Observable Trends:

1) The highest max temperature is recorded in cities closest to the equator. As the location moves further away from the equator, the max temperature decreases.

2) Wind speed is lower in cities closer to the equator. As the location moves further away from the equator, wind speed increases.

3) There are significantly more cities in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere, most likely due to the vast difference in land mass and total population between the two hemispheres.
